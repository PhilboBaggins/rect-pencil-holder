Rectangular pencil holder
=========================

It holds pencils and things of a similar shape.

Fun story: The square holes the pencils are in were originally circles but due to the way OpenSCAD does circles (made up of multiple straight line segments), it was crazy expensive to get laser cut (at least when I tried uploading it to Ponoko.com), so I just changed them to squares; it was much cheaper and quicker to cut.
